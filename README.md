Beamer DEI v2
=============

This is an attempt to reproduce the slide template of Dipartimento di
Elettronica e Informazione -- Politecnico di Milano as as Beamer theme.

Current features:

* a collection of simple tests
* a beamer color theme
* a beamer font theme
* a beamer inner theme
* a beamer outer theme
* a beamer full theme

The partitioning into different themes was done only to organize the sources.
You can use every theme standalone, but this is not encouraged because they were
designed to work together.

Unfortunately, I am not very expert in defining Beamer themes, so any suggestion
to improve the theme is welcome.
